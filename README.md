    Introduction and Play Confirmation:
        The script starts by printing a welcome message and asks the user if they want to play the quiz.
        If the user enters 'Y' or 'y', the quiz starts; otherwise, the script exits.

    Quiz Questions:
        The script presents a series of questions, each followed by an input prompt for the user's answer.
        After the user inputs their answer, the script compares it with the correct answer in a case-insensitive manner.
        If the answer is correct, the script prints a success message and increments the score by 1.
        If the answer is incorrect, the script prints a failure message.

    Scoring:
        The script keeps track of the user's score by incrementing it whenever they answer a question correctly.

    Final Score:
        After all the questions are answered, the script prints the user's total score.

Suggestions for Improvement:

    Enhancing User Experience:
        Consider adding more feedback or encouragement for the user after each answer.
        Allow the user to see the correct answer if they answer incorrectly.

    Handling Invalid Inputs:
        Add input validation to handle unexpected or invalid user inputs gracefully.

    Scalability:
        If you plan to expand the quiz with more questions, consider using data structures like lists or dictionaries to store questions and answers, making it easier to manage and modify the quiz content.
